# Moving-update Kalman algorithm in low-cost Node-Red IoT network for estimating flood water level

**Abstract:** Flooding is one of the most common natural disasters in Vietnam. Although a hy- drological monitoring system has been developed in Vietnam, the adoption of a Flood Warning and Monitoring System (FWMS) is still lim- ited. A practical issue is that the river water levels is rarely flat, but undulating with flood wa- ter ripples, which makes the measurement in- accurate. In this paper, we will design a re- cursive Kalman estimation for fluctuating flood water level in the Node-Red IoT network. In- deed, the low complexity of the popular Kalman filter algorithm is very suitable for a low-cost IoT system like Node-Red. In our experiments, the accuracy of our Kalman algorithm is far su- perior to the standard Moving Average (MA) algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the Kalman filter has been used in a practical Node-Red IoT experiment. We will show that our novel Moving-update Kalman al- gorithm, which combines MA and Kalman meth- ods, can track data recursively without prior knowledge of noiseâ€™s variance. Our novel al- gorithm is of linear complexity and, hence, fast enough for low cost IoT and FWMS systems in developing countries like Vietnam. We also in- cluded the industrial Message Queuing Teleme- try Transport (MQTT) protocol in IoT network in our Node-Red system, which means our de- signed Node-Red proposal is capable of transfer- ring data to any FWMS network via internet.
